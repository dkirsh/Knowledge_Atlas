## Summary

This PR completes the Track 2 Task 1 assignment: fix `ka_contribute_public.html`
so that submitted papers are classified by `atlas_shared`, stored correctly, and
the user sees what happened.

**Two files are modified; twelve are added (all deliverables).**

---

## What was broken

`ka_contribute_public.html` wrote only a filename string to `localStorage` and
unconditionally opened a thank-you modal. No PDF bytes ever left the browser.
`ka_article_endpoints.py` had a fully wired `/api/articles/submit` endpoint but
the `submit_articles` handler never called the classifier — it went from
deduplication straight to `INSERT INTO articles` with `status='staged_pending_review'`
regardless of what the classifier would have said.

---

## What this PR does

### Backend (`ka_article_endpoints.py`)
- Calls `AdaptiveClassifierSubsystem.classify()` inside `submit_articles` for
  every item that passes validation and deduplication
- Routes classifier output through `_route_classifier_verdict`: `accept` →
  `staged_pending_review`; `edge_case` or `next_action` override →
  `needs_review`; off-topic edge case (primary_topic_score < 0.40) →
  `rejected_off_topic`
- Persists `classifier_verdict`, `classifier_article_type`, `classifier_primary_topic`,
  `classifier_overall_confidence`, `classifier_backend` into `validation_notes` JSON
  so reviewers can inspect classifier output without re-running
- Fixes 14 bugs found during Phase-3 verification (Q1–Q6): defensive OSError
  wrap on quarantine write; atomic `_next_id` via `id_sequences` table;
  retry-on-IntegrityError; title/abstract extraction fixes; `paper_id` propagation;
  explicit `next_action` override in router; naming consistency; multi-file batch

### Frontend (`ka_contribute_public.html`)
- Replaces `localStorage` dead-end with `fetch()` POST to
  `window.__KA_CONFIG__.apiBase + "/api/articles/submit"` using `FormData`
- Inline results panel shows per-paper verdict, article type, topic, confidence
- `multiple` attribute on file input; `chosenFiles[]` array; all files sent in
  one POST; results accumulate across sequential submissions
- On network/5xx failure: error card shown, submit re-enabled, modal never opens,
  `localStorage` never written

| **Verification questions** — caught real problems | 15 | [`160sp/verification_log.md`](160sp/verification_log.md) — Q1–Q6; 15 bugs surfaced, 14 fixed, 1 declined by design |
| **Validation** — ≥3 of 4 test papers correct | 20 | [`160sp/validation_matrix.md`](160sp/validation_matrix.md) — **4/4 PASS** on rubric tests + **4/4 supplementary** on contract §8 TC-3/4/5/8 + **20-paper expanded validation** with every routing branch exercised. Response JSONs at `160sp/validation_T[1-4]_response.json` (rubric) and `160sp/validation_TC[3-8]_response.json` (supplementary) |
| **Diagnosis of failures** — spec vs implementation | 15 | [`160sp/validation_matrix.md`](160sp/validation_matrix.md) §D1–D4 + supplementary D-TC3 through D-TC8 |

## How to reproduce

### Requirements

```sh
# Clone the four repos as siblings
git clone https://github.com/kaden-leung/Knowledge_Atlas.git
git clone https://github.com/dkirsh/atlas_shared.git
cd atlas_shared && pip install -e . && cd ..
cd Knowledge_Atlas
git checkout track/2-staging/kaden-leung
```

Verify classifier loads:
```sh
python3 -c "from atlas_shared.classifier_system import AdaptiveClassifierSubsystem; print('OK')"
```

### Run the server

```sh
cd Knowledge_Atlas
python3 ka_auth_server.py
# Server starts on http://127.0.0.1:8765
```

### Submit a test PDF

Open `http://127.0.0.1:8765/160sp/ka_contribute_public.html`, drop a PDF,
click **Send suggestion**. The inline results panel shows the classifier verdict,
article type, topic, and confidence for each submitted file.

### Verify storage

```sh
sqlite3 data/ka_auth.db "
SELECT article_id, status,
       json_extract(validation_notes, '$.classifier_verdict') AS verdict,
       json_extract(validation_notes, '$.classifier_primary_topic') AS topic,
       json_extract(validation_notes, '$.classifier_overall_confidence') AS confidence
FROM articles ORDER BY article_id;
"
```

### Run grader automated tests

```sh
python3 160sp/rubrics/t2/t2_task1_grader.py . --auto-only
```

Expected: all 8 automated tests PASS.

## Test plan

- [ ] `python3 160sp/rubrics/t2/t2_task1_grader.py . --auto-only` — all 8 automated tests green
- [ ] Open contribute page, submit `Building_Environment.pdf` (acoustics paper) → card shows `accept`, stored in `data/storage/quarantine/`
- [ ] Submit clearly off-topic PDF → card shows `rejected`, no quarantine file written
- [ ] Submit citation-only text (no PDF) → card shows `needs_review` per contract skip rule
- [ ] Submit a PDF + a non-PDF renamed to `.pdf` in one batch → valid file staged, bad file shows `rejected_bad_file`, batch does not abort
- [ ] Submit same PDF twice → second shows `duplicate_existing`, no new quarantine file, `articles` row count unchanged
- [ ] Kill server mid-submit (or block fetch) → error card shown, no thank-you modal, submit button re-enabled

---

## Known limitations (classifier quality, not implementation bugs)

- `KA-ART-000001` (`Building_Environment.pdf`, acoustics): classifier returns
  `article_type=meta_analysis` and `primary_topic=Biophilia` — topic and type
  mismatch reflect the constitution bank's coverage, not a routing bug. Routing
  to `staged_pending_review` on `verdict=accept` is correct. Documented as D1
  in `validation_matrix.md`.
- `primary_topic_confidence` clamped to [0,1]: the raw classifier returned 1.08
  for KA-ART-000001; clamped to 1.00 for schema compliance. Fix is in commit
  `4dd9866`.
